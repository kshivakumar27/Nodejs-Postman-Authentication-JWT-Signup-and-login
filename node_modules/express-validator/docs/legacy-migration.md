# Migrating from legacy APIs
From its early versions all the way to the last version 5 release, express-validator has provided
access to validators through the express request object, like this:

```js
req.checkBody('email').isEmail();
req.checkBody('password').notEmpty();
const errors = req.validationErrors();
if (errors) {
  req.status(422).json({
    errors
  });
}

// Successful request. Proceed with something ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
```

From version 4 onwards, that style has been called "the legacy API", and the recommended way to
validate your requests is with the `check()` API. Both styles have coexisted until version 6 came out
and completely removed the legacy API.

Below are detailed steps on how to migrate from the legacy API to the modern one.
